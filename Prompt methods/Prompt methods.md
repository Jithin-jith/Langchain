## LangChain Prompting Techniques

LangChain provides various prompt engineering techniques to structure interactions with LLMs. This document explores different prompt methods with detailed explanations.

# 1. Single-Shot Prompt

# Overview

A single-shot prompt provides a single instruction or question to the model. It is straightforward and does not include examples for context.

Use Case

- Simple queries

- Direct translations

- Fact-based questions

# 2. Few-Shot Prompt

# Overview

A few-shot prompt provides multiple examples to guide the modelâ€™s response. It improves accuracy by showing patterns in expected outputs.

Use Case

- Text classification

- Language translation with better context

- Question-answering

# 3. Multi-Prompt (Dynamic Selection)

# Overview

Multi-prompting selects different prompt templates dynamically based on the context. This ensures more relevant responses by adapting to query complexity.

Use Case

- Selecting examples based on input length

- Dynamic query-response adaptation

- Personalized chatbot responses

# 4. Chain of Thought (CoT) Prompting

# Overview

Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting encourages step-by-step reasoning instead of immediate answers. This improves accuracy for complex queries.

Use Case

- Mathematical reasoning

- Logical problem-solving

- Step-by-step breakdowns

# 5. Self-Ask Prompting

# Overview

Self-ask prompting instructs the model to break down complex queries into sub-questions before answering. This enhances accuracy for knowledge-based queries.

Use Case

- Answering multi-step questions

- Breaking down large topics

- Improving answer clarity
