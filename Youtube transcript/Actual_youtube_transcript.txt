it's time to check the vibe yeah we are talking about the vibe coding now this term was coined last month and it's basically building application with the help of AI so we got a new term sound skirt and from last few days on different social media people are talking about VIP coding even on LinkedIn and people are making videos on YouTube and then I realized okay I have to check out what VIP coding is but then I have not got enough time to check it and then someone posted about the Andrew NG course on WIP coding and then I thought okay maybe it is important but then turned out to be a sponsored course and it makes sense doesn't matter what the platform is but then I thought about WIP coding and these are my thoughts on it now since I am doing development from a long time and I'm also exploring how do you build AI based application or we can we have a new term there which is AI engineering so how do we use this all the L model in your application how do we integrate it and then how do you build applications or how do you codee with the help of AI so I'm exploring all those things from last few months and these are my thoughts okay so in fact I got three points and normally I don't write my points but I thought this time I should so I got three points which I want to talk about now the first thing is when you work with this the coding agents it can be on different languages recently I made a video on intell J juny which provides you or which helps you to build application not just it will not just give you the code but it will give you the project structure as well so what you normally do is if you want to build application doesn't matter if you know coding or if you don't know coding and if you know Java or not you can still build application in Java so what you do is get inj get Juni which is the product by jet brains again a paid product but once you have that or if you don't want to use that we got vs code with the help of GitHub co-pilot you can open that and even if you don't know coding as I mentioned before you can write the prompt you just have to be good with the language or the English so you type what you want properly and you have to explain everything to the AI model this is what I want and then it will not just give you the code but it will create the entire project structure maybe the front end back end and then you will get everything it may not work and most of the time it gives you errors okay but now you'll be thinking okay it gives you erors of no use you know in future no one is going to use all these tools see the thing is two there are two things here in fact first yes it gives you error but then if you copy the error and if you give it to the agent by saying hey you know I got this project from you and this is the error which I'm getting when I'm running this it will give you solution and you don't have to actually copy paste the code you just have to click a button and automatically it will change the project it will change the files and it will add required things there and it will make it work so if you do this multiple times it may not work second time as well but somewhere it will work if you want to build the same application by yourself it may take one week or one month but AI tool can do that in minutes of course maybe after doing multiple erors and stuff it will work one point second even if you think about AI Solutions now which are giving issues AI is improving day by day so maybe it is this time it it takes around three to four rounds to give you the working product in future it might give you in the first attempt itself and maybe we are waiting for that day where AI is doing everything and we are sitting there by thinking AI is not going to replace us and suddenly you will get one solution or one model which says it's done and that day it will be done for us okay that's one okay so that's my point about AI so yeah so there are s positive things and negative things about VIP coding the positive thing is this it works okay and even if you don't know coding you can still write out so let's talk about photography now in the earlier days let's go to 1980s you need a special person who know who has all the skills of taking a photo uh you know printing it out and all the stuff now you just need a phone anyone anyone can be a photographer in the earlier days that was not the scene the same is happening to coding now where uh if you want to build a software you need developers expert developers who knows what they're doing and they will build a project but now anyone who has no idea what coding is can build the product and it will work okay so those are the positive things let me talk about certain negative part about it okay not negative but then there is somewhere we have to also understand how things are going so the second part is the software Solutions you know whatever solution you think about you know if you want to book a cab we use Uber Ola if you want to order something online we use Amazon so we have all these Solutions right and even if you want to transfer money we have banking applications in fact we I'm not sure whenever last time I went to a bank normally we do everything online now and if you think about all these Solutions and if you're thinking okay because of one software these companies are running that's not the scenario the thing is to build a company or to make money from softwares it's not just about software there are lot of things goes be behind the scene so as a human we have to understand what is a problem you're are trying to solve okay and that's a big part of all these things most of the time we don't even know what's the problem we are trying to solve and sometime we'll we build Solutions and then we search for the problems right but yeah so this is this is one problem you need humans who understand the problem and who will try to find a solution of course while doing this they can take help of the AI to get the help of the solution but you need someone who will find the problem next one particular company is not linear okay so a company has multiple moving parts right and building one software will not solve it okay so we have we have multiple connections there and a human can make those connections it's not the job of a software to make those connections as a human we know okay this is how the this department is working this is how the customers are thinking about the product and all the stuff so a human can do that not a AI solution in future maybe okay so when AGI is there and I'm not sure when it will be uh some people say next year or maybe after 30 years no one knows okay but once it is there it might try to do that at this point AI can't do that so all those connections need human touch now if you're thinking okay you are safe now okay you need humans but you have to also also understand these humans are not normal humans now they need special skills because now the speed has increased of building the product and helping the company and you are using AI to do that so maybe in the earlier scenario if you need 10 people to do that now maybe you need two or three so basically you have to compete with those three or two people and these people need to be expert in using the AI Solutions and also you can't simply have one skill set okay so a lot of people have this idea of mastering one thing I think with the help of AI you don't need one Mastery or maybe you need one but you also need the other skill set okay so we have this something called t-shape developer which I'm talking from a long time uh everyone need to have the skill set you need to be master in one thing but you need the belth of knowledge so that when you are finding Solutions because most of the thing will be done done by Ai and when you get the solution you need to understand what is happening there okay so you need human touch now since we are talking about the architecture let me come back to the third part software is not just about syntax most of the AI Solutions if you ask for a question they will give you everything and it may work but when you think about software development see building a product is easy it's very easy okay AI is just making it faster but still software development is easy what is difficult is making a good application which can be maintained for years which which will not have uh security issues of course I'm not saying there can be a software which is 100% bug bug proof but you need to have make sure that your you have less number of bugs in your application and what happens is because of this white WIP coding you basically build the application and you got the code it works and you think my job is done let's me take this product deploy it on the cloud and my job is done that's the problem if it works for one month there are people in the world who knows how to hack those applications and they will do it because you have not tested it maybe you fired your testing Department maybe you you fired your security department who are responsible to handle this stuff even developers you know when we build application if you are properly trained security comes first okay so every time we create a particular we even if when you write one line of code we think about it is it secure example in SQL when you are working with jdbc we we think about how do we avoid SQL injection I'm just giv an example there multiple things which comes into picture or memory memory leakage so we we think about those things when we write a code but will AI do that and even if a is doing it are you verifying it and if you know if you don't have any idea how a programming language works or what is syntax you can't do that so yes you need developers here okay so just don't just think about software development as a working product it's there are multiple things the architecture of the product also where you're going to deploy it is it is it scalable is it maintainable so there are multiple aspects we have to think about so those are the three points but I want to add one more here which is a bonus because it was not part of the plan but I just uh remember that you know from last 20 years when you think about software development it is changing very very fast okay I remember when I started coding in fact before me when I I used to talk to my seniors they used to work with desktop based applications so anybody they want to build application they were thinking okay how do we make it work on a desktop but then things started changing for web okay so most of the application moved from desktop to web then they moved from web to SAS and things started deploying on the cloud and then we started building for cloud so all these changes happened is because there was some humans in between they thought okay this is not optimized let let me just make it more optimized okay or maybe I just want to make it more easy for deployment maybe I want to make it more easy for us users to use it so as a human we continuously evolve in terms of us or in terms of software but if you think about ai ai is been trained on existing applications so what they will give you now is existing Solutions because they're trained on existing existing code so if any you want to build application you will give the prompt an AI will give you the answer maybe that works but there's no Evolution there there's no improvement it's just giving you the things which are there and maybe if you are continuously depending on it you are not doing any Improvement in the software industry okay so it moved from here to there and suddenly now it's flat of course there's a there's advancement in AI but not in actual Solutions uh that those are the things you have to remember when you think about WIP coding what will happen in future things are iy things are Ching very fast but yeah don't worry it's just that keep improving yourself use AI whenever you build build things and uh uh just be cautious what code you getting from the AI so let me know your thoughts I'm curious okay so let's discuss this in the comment section or maybe I will just read your comments and make another video to clarify certain things and yeah see you in the next video bye-bye
