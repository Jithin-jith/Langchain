foreign [Applause] [Music] you have appeared at some storytelling competition yes encoding also if MCC yes football scores tournament watching League football yes not many hobbies and achievements Football Club your option is geography yes you have worked as EDI developer in New Delhi yes you appeared at the capf also okay what was the result so I couldn't clear the um okay and in 2020 Indian Postal Service you are allocated but you did not join I joined forever you are undergoing training uh okay so first of all let me ask you you are from Kerala yes and uh why is it that that many people go to the Middle East why is it that Kerala contributes so much towards different forms of force labor force and others in in the Middle East so the primary reason is the underdeveloped industrial sector in Kerala okay so it does not provide much employment opportunities to the large population here so the people started assorting to Middle East for uh especially blue quarter workers for availing day-to-day living wages the second one could be certainly geographical opportunity to the Middle Eastern region so in 1970s when the migration has started uh it was accessible for the tail lights to go to Middle East Via various ships and Maritime groups the third thing would be sir be cultural similarity ever since the historic times the Kerala had business ties would be Arab traders so it has continued to take shape of the in the form of modern migration in the 1970s and the original now uh since so many men folk are leaving for the Middle East is that the reason why the the sex ratio is quite good in Kerala in favor of women is it so closer no no it definitely uh due to the respect that the society has given to women since historically the sex selective about it one area where the women of Kerala are extremely famous internationally can you tell me some nursing nursing absolutely right so uh now let me ask you one thing have you ever heard the word Esperanto have you ever heard about it no sir you know okay so there was an attempt to have a universal language for the entire world so International universal language was called Esperanto and it started in 1880s but of course never took final shape but it was it was very much there at that point of time when they conceived that that the entire world have only uniform language uh since you have appeared at capf what is meant by SSB uh yeah so where is it deployed among the uh Nepal border yeah absolutely correct okay what is conscription and do you are you in favor of conscription the compulsory military services yeah because people should be given a choice uh where to whether to join the military because military is uh not the only way to serve the nation because each and every person to their own different Employments are doing great service to the country but in times of war and natural calamities it's have a huge impact on the security of our country measures of conscription can be attached to but in normal circumstances anything happen during the Russia Ukraine war also which was related to the compulsory military training in Russia and ultimately that resulted in a debacle something to do with conscription absolutely uh now have you heard the word have you heard this is in Kerala what is the name by which it is called is called what are the functions Village officer so what are its functions many functions many uh sectors in the room what would be the revenue to lecture of the land records yeah all right yes correct absolutely yeah correct second would be the uh the demographic and releases yes correct absolutely plays a very important part in the revenue Administration can you tell me who are the officers above him and who are below him in Revenue Administration okay you can go and read about it so you have the collector from the top then SDM then then you have functional is below like in in Northern linear we are called and patwaris so its similar names would be given Kerala also okay uh can you tell me why economics and political science they are regarded as Sciences political science of course it has this world science in it and economics also is regarded as size why and easy so in both political and political science and economic sense we have theories and assumptions so that would be one reason why we call them uh science and with respect to the method of studying or research conducted uh the political science and uh economic Sciences especially nowadays this is more yeah require more research oriented caucus so the method of studying tools used maybe another reason why it is called Society yeah and and many things can be reduced to numbers so therefore it is a science so many things in economics and political science also can be reduced to numbers now just last question I am going to ask you uh football is also uh called by some other name also soccer yeah okay and now tell me just one thing that the Indian Postal Service so you to which in which you are working so there was a time it was there was another department or Ministry which was working along with this and they were part of a much huge Ministry what was that so telecommunication Department it has been converted into a corporate body what is that called the BSN okay so uh just one more thing which I am going to ask you that supposing you are posted now you get into is and you are posted in the district The Lure itself you get your home guard up what is one thing which you are going to improve in that District for which people will remember you even after you are transferred out from that please what is that you would like to do there so the major thing I would do would be to improve the tourism potential of this thing because due to the resource base we do not have much industry so if you are able to work upon and improve the tourism sector we can create a self-sustaining Revenue model of sustainable tools so that it will provide livelihood to the people we will ensure development of the infrastructure in the area so by the promotion of Tourism sector would be the one thing which I will do so just related to tourism covid-19 has had a hit on the airlines business of Airlines and tourism do you think there are chances of Revival in the near future yes sir definitely because uh after the rolling out of vaccines and all the international flights has been again re-established but that uh inertia is still there people are still showing up apprehensions to vcp International countries but in three or four years we will definitely able to cash back to the uh all the dice of glory to the tourism okay thank you when are you undergoing Trading that's the other you've been there for how long one month how do you rank that City that the city is nice but it has a little bit contested when we compare to the city back in Kerala and very very crowded crowded and the pollution level are also a little bit High when we compare it to the is there any City in Kerala which you can compare with I mean similar City pollution the in pollution sir I cannot because due to the maritime effect the air quality that is pretty uh during times of uh the population the city of uh one study revealed that always impact or instances were lower in places with which had big green cover right so what was it like in Kerala it was not very good I think the number of cases was pretty high they were very high but the government was able to manage the cash loans because the hospital was able to accommodate the cases and the number of attacks recorded also have been you know so this study that I am referring to is not really it doesn't not relevant or doesn't see the story of Kerala context even though the greenery was there the case number was pretty high due to the population density Factor but in Western Country it might be true okay this hobby of yours storytelling yes to tell the story in what way you sit down and speak out to the people or there is somebody acting also along with you or I mean what form exactly so this was a competitive item in which I participated in Kerala State useless just once you just wonder but if you have to go from school level to sub District district state level so we have been able to participate in this later so it would be a team of five members so the one guy would be standing in the center and telling the story and we have certain musical instruments accompanying us we have Tabla we have violin we have bells and we have Harmony so it's a mix of songs and stories we'll recite a story and in between we'll see storytelling is only by one person one person and out of this musical accompanying a compliment there is nobody dancing no sir no but they'll sing along with us but I believe there is some dance form also where you I mean whereby you tell your story yes it's uh in Kerala we have here foreign okay that's also a form of Storytelling uh okay quickly Supreme Court has issued uh an order and the final order would come but one of the Interior models says that government is Duty bound to prevent you know possible instances of communal Harmony breach of communal Harmony right are you aware of this order sir and the recent Communities going on around the ncrv yeah yeah I mean not exactly but something I mean similar so you are right my question is that is it going to add a major headache to The District administration and Law and Order authorities uh no sir because maintaining the maintaining the communal hormone is definitely part of maintaining Law and Order so it may put some extra burden in the initial phase but we if you look at the long term having a community harmonious Society will uh it will be able to maintain lower in order in future process but these kind of possibilities I mean where a breach could take place they are most of the time patronized by local politicians powerful politicians and who will you know go by whatever may happen including you know to the level of Chief ministers I mean they are patronizing these kind of things so how how do you deal in a situation like this I mean one side Supreme Court and the country expects you to maintain peace and on the other you have pressure from all uh political Lobby definitely by including the politicians in the peace building consensus because you have to educate them and make the locker level political work is more available issues it will happen in the afterward of a huge conversation it will be educating the masses along with the participation of local level leaders in peace building consensus would be one steps and we should definitely try to implement the order but the politicization of the issue should be addressed at the root cause by educating and making more awareness among the people and local leaders but if they don't listen to same advice then who do you know so we should refer to the legal measures we should take action against people whose practice information okay thank you Alfred yes geography is your subject okay so if I may say geography can be a blessing Boon and it can also be a vein can you contextualize this statement in the context of Pakistan how it is applicable to them may I repeat geography can be blessing boon or it can be a bin contextualize it in the context of Pakistan how it has been a boon let's have that first so the Strategic location of Pakistan and its proximity to restations the scintillation countries because most of the Western countries look for cross-ties you participants okay but if you see the baby so how Pakistan leveraged it during after the second world war and partition for Independence the Pakistan has been a closerly to U.S so they have leveraged their position to get more investment so which paths did it join so I cannot recall that okay so and what else respective brain the uh ethnic diversity due to the mountain is stirring and the ethnic diversity in its borders are acting as a vein for Pakistan due to its geographical diversity okay and uh there is one factor which has made Pakistan completely obsessed and it is uh taking all necessary measures so the hint is with respect to Afghanistan and its policy towards Afghanistan what is that particular thing can you put your finger on that Pakistan is obsessed with something strategic depth its obsession with the concept of trying to find a strategic depth specially for its nuclear assets because in which the Indian armed forces can overrun it in you know no time because it doesn't have the depth there is no place for maneuvering so it has got a system it wants to control Afghanistan so that it can you see that is why they have been establishing after Soviet withdrawal they established their terrorist camps training camps there in Afghanistan so that there is deniability okay geography determines the history of a country your brief comment on that geography has very much linked to the political and The Invasion if you look at throughout history of the country with respect to India if you see the maritime centrality and its particular geographic location has been attracting trailers since ancient period And if we look at the North and India the Cyber pass through which the centralization injection scheme it has indeed determined the history of India throughout the ancient material thank you foreign did you find did you finalize your service preferences yes much before it's uh I've you know only up to uh Indian originally no this is the you have given your options for various Services yes it is is foreign defense Estates Indian corporate law daily and demand and nicobar you're still interested in these Services then this is older okay Indian postal service is a very highly Professional Service I would say and it is known for its innovative you know achievements do you know any one of these achievements yes I've seen set the Indian Postal Services has been doing uh many achievements and a great service to the countries for the last 150 years so one among the major achievements is its large Network we have a 1.5 lack of large positive which has been acting as a strategic camp for government to for carrying out various developmental activities for instance you have been carrying out the door cash delivery the other enabled payment system during the covet and the postal Department was declared as an essential Services during the coverage and with respect to financial inclusions are the department has come up with the India post payment bank so it has been working towards improving the financial knowledge and financial inclusion of the people especially among backward districts and all okay uh does it have a union Postal Service do you face the problem of unions yes very strong uh so you know someone is supported by the communist yes so today is the Labor Day are you aware of that we have forgotten about the first way I mean what is the importance of doing a Labor Day sir I am not out of the exact reason which was but in uh NPI it has been largely used for the uh for promoting the uh course of the welfare of labors and it is also for remembering uh various marketship and happened in the course for levels especially first of May what happened on first of May foreign finals they're very common a king of by the by your neighbors particularly China and Pakistan they're hacking our sites very often so is there any counter agency in our country to subvert these moves that we have certain which has been certim the computer Emergency Response Team which is the primary responder in terms of computer attacks then there is also a national critical information infrastructure protection Center which has been taken charge for protecting the critical information the governmental data so the under the national cyber policy these are the two institutional structures that apart from that various State have come up with their own initiative to protect their cyber domains such you're very much fond of playing and watching football you know what is nuclear football yes this is a suitcase being carried by the United States President it is carried this facility is available energy by any states Services is this facility only available to the United States so the term is famous in terms of uh United States president but I'm not aware if it's available does India have a nuclear football no sir we have a structure where there is an overall oversight the civilian what is the purpose of nuclear football so it is to launch a retaliatory military attack uh within a short span of time so the response time would be minimized and the number of agencies involved would be also minimized and he the president will be able to order the nuclear attack wherever he is because he's carrying the suitcase along okay uh one last question Kerala is not uh famous for industrial you know Industries there are not many Industries probably due to Union problems yes am I right yes and it is largely its economy is largely dependent upon the remittance is that it receives from the capitalist countries yes the carolites they send lot of money every year so it is not so much industrialized as Maharashtra or Gujarat or should it not be it should some action not be taken to invite foreign capital for setting up Industries yes definitely it has to be taken with respect to the research resource base of Kerala if we compare it to other states we denote how much natural resources but as of now the government is promoting more service oriented Industries and I.T parts so the various startup events and Global Innovation events are going to attract the global companies to the it hubs especially in coaching and trivandrums thank you very much so what's the rank of Kerala energy sir it's the with respect to last census it is the first and with respect to health parameters it is the first reason and with respect to the state GDP so how do you see this disconnect between the lagging State GDP and stopping the charts of literacy and health is there a negative correlation between them so be modeling with lower per capita GDP and higher Social indicators affecting counted as the Kerala model by the economics uh it has been mainly achieved due to the fact that there has been a high expenditure on social services in the public budget especially with respect to health and education so it has resulted in a robust health and education system which has resulted in this data points where Kerala is leading in literacy and health parameters so can we say that uh the socialism that is mentioned in the Preamble to the Constitution of India is strictly followed in Kerala and not in other parts of the country so it is not strictly followed because it's not strictly because the it's not everything is in the control of State even we have the private hospitals and so Indian socialism means that everything should improve by state no sorry Indian context of socialism it's a mix of mixed electron but in the actual types of socialism where the state control is very much prevalent in the overall system it is not being practiced in Kerala because we have the Christian Missionary schools and the in school system also we are following the Aid at school system where the infrastructure would be provided by various managements but the operating cost will be provided by the government so that sort of mixer system has helped to Kerala to achieve this good parameter which is the state that runs first in the state GDP sir Maharashtra what's the difference in the socialism of Maharashtra and socialism of Kerala sir in Maharashtra it's more industrial friendly state it is more Industries but with respect to Maharashtra does not have socialism so it does not have a socialistic setup of government where the overall control of government is uh so they're not following the Constitution no sir they're not following they're following the model of Indian constitution Indian socialism they are giving uh more impetus to the welfare of the people and they are accommodating the needs of the people no what's the difference between the socialism followed in Kerala and socialism followed in Maharashtra okay so what are the major sources of revenue when it comes to care the major sources are remittances then the tax income from the beverages lotteries and the third income would be the service the tourist successor and the IT enable service can you list three items from Kerala that have a geographical indicator tank the second would be the number manga from kannur so these two are the one I could think of how about mangoes chili jaggery pineapple pakali rice or curry rice it's there so I'll be focusing upon the export of these items so uh yes sir with respect to uh with regards to foreign trade what is the role of Kerala sir uh Kerala is primarily the food crops are being exported especially to the station countries due to the demand but apart from that the export contribution is pretty much low as compared to other states in Canada so are we implementing Sagar Mala project in Kerala okay so you have mentioned your language your mother tongue to be Malayalam yes sir how do you okay so first of all how has been your experience in ghaziabad do you feel a cultural disconnect or do you feel that India is one country and asked humble mentions fraternity of dignity of an individual so with regards to the Preamble do you see that you are you know we are one mixed up Society or do you feel some disconnect with regards to your hometown sir uh I feel a cultural difference but I do not feel a disconnected because we have many similarities which unites us but with respect to uh the food dressing and the climate everything and I'm feeling a cultural difference but it does not necessarily mean a disconnector because we are able to find unity in differences and Harmony in different systems so how do you see this particular Point your mother tongue is Malayalam most of the schemes of government of India but other schemes have this Hindi connotation or maybe a Hindi keyword but not a malayali keyword do you see that Malayalam is being neglected in that sense no sir because due to the implementation of three language policy Hindi has been widely understood by the fan in their population and with respect to government schemes we have been a focus on finding their level to attract all the Indians so naming the uh different schemes in Hindi will give it more publicity but sir at the same time I also believe that there should be uh measures to spread these schemes in local level languages as well by naming and branding them in locker level so that it will beat people of all regions then why there is this opposition to declare Hindi as the national language of India so uh I should not believe there should be any national language for India because the diversity of India itself says that we are a land of multiple languages but with respect to official purposes we have accepted Hindi and English as the official language but in case of national language uh I should I believe that the current status should continue okay since you belong to the Christian Community suppose you own a piece of land can government acquire it yes with respect to individual ownership with respect to land I'm saying okay so what fundamental rights do you have as an individual when you own a property being a Christian if you are owning a property in India what land acquisition rights you have as per the part three of the Indian constitution sir uh for individual ownership I think it's the same for everyone but with respect to minority institutions there have been certain protection supported what kind of minority institutions so the religious minority and linguistic minority suppose you own a Christian religious institution and that is built upon a piece of land can government of India acquire it without due compensation no sir they have to give you compensation you can approach Supreme Court for that notice that after giving compensation The Government Can acquire the land owned by the minority institutions okay my next segment would be uh who is the governor of your state sir it's uh honorable governor have you seen the conflict between the governor and the chief minister of Kerala and the Kerala State cabinet in the recent past yes what do you think is the root cause of that conflict so the root causes with refer to the appointment of various uh cost of universities so that has been the root cause but apart from that the overall power tussle is also reflecting uh in the ongoing issues how about this particular notion that the governor of the state should be appointed from within the state itself and he should not be an outsider sir uh the governor it's best to appoint a person from outside the state so that he's not much involved in the internal politics of the state and being an outsider he may not have much conflict of interest coming in his space while he's acting as a office of governor my last question since you work in the postal Department I'll slightly differ from that what is the significance of radio in today's world so the significance of radio has been uh reduced due to the development should prime minister shift his money back to some other social media platform apart from radio so it is available in YouTube and other platform as well due to its uh right so why he focuses upon radio as a specific means to convey his man give up so uh even in the present scenario in the rural India many people still depends upon radio for getting information especially in the geographically isolated terrains so the widespread accessibility would be one reason where prime minister still sort two radio to convey its main keyboards but number of mobile users in India are more than number of radio user users and the mobile and the internet penetration is increasing so how do you see it in that context so the availability of radio is a universal thing even in with respect to mobile phones even with respect to other devices the radio is pretty much accessible if you compare other mediums of information such as television ammo so that accessibility and Universal availability factor is One Piece right and very last question since uh you belong to an agricultural family yes what are three major challenges that as an agricultural family you face and those challenges are not present in the Green Revolution way but are present in south of India so uh the primary issue would be the availability of high yielding varieties of crops because majority of research has been going on in rice and wheat but the staple cultivation crops in Kerala are coconut rabarano so the advancement is in high yielding hope would be one reason the second thing would be sir the vagaries of monsoon especially in the recent decade due to climate change the monsoon has become too much unpredictable in Kerala and it has causing which spread huge spread loss especially in concrete and plantain cultivation but that Monsoon variability is present in North India as well so how Kerala is different from that because it's the state where the monsoon reaches fast and it has major influence the third thing would be with respect to the uh procurement system in Kerala we does not have apmc and the Monday system so the procurement system is another challenge which is unique to care thank you thank you Alfred will take you back for a while and we'll call you again feedback okay so you just wait there thank you foreign so you still have about a week okay so uh this is the first time you're appearing at the CSC interview no so it's my second year but how many months did you get last time 187 not bad or 87 was Good 87 but this time I think the performance which you have given but before I say that let me ask you how do you think you performed at this interview so I really have a little bit nervous with respect to certain questions okay so which questions you were nervous the initial phase will coming down and settling down okay and but later on then you were able to so let me say Alfred that you are very good your answers were to the point crisp and you are able you were very calm and composed so your the external appearance of your body language the communication skills the articulation skills excellent your choice of words was absolutely fine and I can say with confidence that you have come out with very very good performance in this particular opportunity and I think this time you should be able to go past 200. definitely having said that there are certain areas where we first of all I'll talk to you about your strengths so your mental alertness was definitely definitely very good and you are able to face a volley of questions one after another with ease and you were able to give very convincing answers also so that again is a is a very great quality that one does not loses the the confidence or the balance which you were able to maintain the balance very then I would say that your knowledge Also regarding Kerala very good your knowledge about the political things also associated with this country and Kerala in particular they were very good your knowledge about current affairs again was very good about the foreign policy and things associated with International World Order Arena they were also very good uh we did not ask many questions on your hobbies and not many questions on your computer science but one one thing I am certain that as far as your knowledge about Kerala is very sad now computer science you need to prepare because so many things that though when we asked you about the agencies which are there to prevent hacking you were able to come out fairly well with the respect to those but computer science you can brush up your knowledge slightly more and then Hobbies storytelling coding and and other things achievement NCC football you can prepare that very well I'm sure and then coming to your geography now geography with one or two questions were asked how geography affects you know the history and the second thing was about uh the question which was asked regarding Afghanistan one factor which has made Park really Pakistan really obsessed with something so that the Strategic depth after that was one point where probably going to go back and study slightly more but geography can be a blessing mood you were able to come out with that answer again uh I was surprised because I was asking you SSB normally people say that it is SEMA surakshabal which is the BSF but you said the correct thing that is Sasha's receivable which was the correct thing normally people Esperanto I did not expect that you would be knowing because Esperanto is something which was an old concept for an international universal language and other things also you were very fine absolutely and questions regarding Indian Postal Service also you were able to come out very very the significance of midi so that you since you will be going on a particular day ninth of this is our 9th of May oh so the yeah so 9th May uh the particular day if there is anything famous about ninth may you should prepare that and then of course regarding issues connected with nuclear football and other you know National critical information certain Etc that you are doing very well you came out then let me now just come to some of the points which are GI from Kerala that you came out with two of them that's later on after nudging you were able to come out with the third one also and regarding language issues at the governor CM conflicts Etc again you were able to very well give the answer so now let me uh just briefly tell you what are the things where you would we would like you to prepare slightly the idea is only to help you and encourage you that if you start working in those directions also then you will have a well-rounded personality to present yourself one thing is that whenever you give answers and it's not to say that you are not giving answer this is just previous suggestion the answer should be there will be many parts to that so choose the most important part first prioritize so that otherwise if you come to the third least important part Point first then the panelists will feel he doesn't know about the main most important thing so he will move on to the next question so first of all Let It turn inside your head and then come up with the most important reason for that then come to the list that's important then less important secondly always give examples any theoretical concept anything always give example accountability give example you can give shastri or many things can be talked about empathy Etc you can give example of rusi Modi you can give example of accountability Satish dhavan so there are many uh so whenever you give example it will actually impress the panelists much more and lastly Whenever there is a controversial question try to give both the sides of the answer so the pros and the cons so the question may be many which are controversial maybe religious in nature corruption it can be related to article 370 demonetization can be surgical strike it can be CAA register and so many where you must give both the sides and then if you are persist they persist that you give your view then follow the official line don't be take the risk don't be revolutionary there to give your ideas you should follow the official line okay so then learn more about the about everything about Kerala that I have said you take out some book on Kerala agricultural practices and what are the crops which are shown there in irrigation so tourism is an important area which you already thought I'd ask you question about whether you look forward to tourism coming up you said yes the flights are opening up and so on Kobe related question was also asked to you uh so they're there also you came out with fair living now uh question on geography so not many questions can come on geography so be prepared on that also simple questions can come why two tides what are the reason for trades pollution ipcc climate change so anything connected with geography make a good reading about geography and then the question may come on the panchati Raja institutions so prepare them well the three tiers what are their functions who are the official actors and so on repair about the role of the District administration role of the collector different roles are there and then one question which is very natural is why civil service why do you want to come to civil service that you should prepare fairly well I am going to suggest to you just one answer you think about it that the answer to the why what attracts you to the Civil Service it is that it is unique in many senses many views number one it offers a very very highly responsible and Leadership positions at a very young age at the age of 25 you can enter the Indian administrative service it offers that opportunity which is not available in any other service secondly it it helps you to be a part of the public policy making process so which is again a very important area because policy formulation policy implementation and policy evaluation that cycle the civil servant performs that cycle in 35 years of his life which is a unique experience thirdly you are a part of the governance and you can affect the lives of the citizens of this country the fourth is it gives you a lot of many opportunity for being creative and innovative prime minister distributes awards for best practices by the civil servants so it leads to lot of satisfaction and praise so that is so these are the reasons why civil service is unique in medicines and one more thing which I would say is public policies so public policies regarding different sectors women children senior citizens schedule tribes and the handicapped people so that also you should prepare very well so this is the overall thing and of course in Russia Ukraine war and the supply chain disruption stand up India startup India gym you know all these things uh which are the things connected with uh obtaining self-reliance by this country is is again a very important area and it started with Trump when he said looking inwards America first so probably we are moving into a direction India first first of all we have to take care of our Indians and then lastly role of the United Nations institutions that you should prepare you are very good there is no doubt about it if you have any questions you can ask us sir Ultra respect to hand gestures and you can keep on your legs it's your hair like you are keeping overdoing it because perfectly fine so that's your natural style be your natural server that is important now don't make an attempt to change your natural style you are absolutely fine the way you are reply because there will be people who will have different views on the subject you will give the reply that India Hindi and English both are the official languages and three language formula but it will be a good idea if the schemes of the government of India can also be translated into other language to make it more popular which is a very good thing and we are regarding national language you can say that it is a kind of a linked language but so therefore I think the matter as it starts today is going on well okay all the best to you thank you you will do very well we'll see you as a civil sermon shortly he's already civil servant yeah but then the services which he wants to acquire ultimately he'll like to see you there all the best [Music] [Music] on Academy let's crack it
